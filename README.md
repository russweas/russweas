### Hello!

I'm Russell, a CS student at The University of Alabama graduating in December 2021 with intern experience at Facebook and SAS. After graduating, I'd love to find a position where I can use Rust in distributed backend systems. My most used languages at the moment are Rust, Go, Hack/PHP, Java, JavaScript, and C++. 

My current main project is [Hermod](https://github.com/hermodapp/api), my senior design project at The University of Alabama. The project is powered by Rust, PostgresDB, and Redis.

### Hello!

I'm Russell, a CS student at The University of Alabama graduating in December 2021 with intern experience at Facebook and SAS. After graduating, I'd love to find a position where I can use Rust in distributed backend systems. My most used languages at the moment are Rust, Go, Hack/PHP, Java, JavaScript, and C++. 

My current side project is [zero2prod](https://github.com/russweas/zero2prod), an implementation of [@LukeMathWalker](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker)'s excellent [zero-to-production book](https://www.zero2prod.com).

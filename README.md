### Hello!

I'm Russell, a CS student at The University of Alabama graduating in December 2021 with intern experience at Facebook and SAS. My most used languages at the moment are Rust, Go, Hack/PHP, Java, JavaScript, and C++. 

My current main project is [Hermod](https://github.com/hermodapp/api), my senior design project at The University of Alabama. The project is powered by Rust and PostgresDB, and hosted on Digital Ocean. 

I'm also working on [Healthcheck.rs](https://github.com/healthcheck-rs), a Rust microsite that can be used to monitor other website's uptime.
